        <h1>Shipping an MVP to production in under 4 weeks</h1>
        <p class="eyebrow">Case Study · MVP · Startup · Architecture</p>
        <p>
          I led a focused MVP build that prioritized core user flows, fast feedback loops, and a production-ready foundation. The goal was to validate product-market fit quickly while keeping the codebase maintainable.
        </p>

        <h2>Strategy</h2>
        <p>
          We defined a minimal scope, implemented essential onboarding and core features, and instrumented analytics to track activation metrics. The architecture used a server-rendered landing with API-driven microservices so future features could be added without major rewrites.
        </p>

        <h2>Execution</h2>
        <p>
          Working closely with the founder, I prioritized the two-week sprint cadence, shipped an initial beta within two weeks, and iterated quickly based on customer feedback. CI/CD pipelines and automated tests ensured stability during rapid releases.
        </p>

        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>MVP launched and reached initial users within three weeks.</li>
          <li>Validated pricing and key workflows, reducing risk for larger investments.</li>
          <li>Established a codebase that supported fast iteration and scale.</li>
        </ul>
