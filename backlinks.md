# Backlink strategy and outreach templates

- **Goal:** Acquire high-quality backlinks to improve authority and help the site rank for hiring/product keywords.
- **Priority targets:** LinkedIn profile (already present), GitHub (present), Medium, Dev.to, Hashnode, Product Hunt, relevant startup/tech blogs, and niche directories (Clutch, GoodFirms if applicable).

## Suggested link locations

- Personal profiles: LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, StackOverflow
- Developer networks: Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium (publish a case study)
- Project/product pages: Product Hunt (for launches), GitHub repo READMEs
- Portfolio directories: Designer/dev directories and relevant startup directories

## Outreach template (connection / message)

Subject: Quick note — link to Hasnain Qureshi’s portfolio

Hi [Name],

I enjoyed your article/post on [topic]. I recently published a portfolio and case study about scaling SaaS performance (https://hasnainqureshi.online/) — thought it might be a useful resource for your readers. If you find it relevant, would you consider linking to it from [page]? Happy to provide a short blurb or guest post.

Thanks,
Hasnain Qureshi

## Quick actions you can take

- Publish a case study (500–1,000 words) on Dev.to/Medium linking to the portfolio.
- Submit the site to Product Hunt when you launch a new project.
- Add the portfolio link to your GitHub README and LinkedIn Featured section.
- Reach out to past clients or collaborators and ask for a mention/link on their sites.

## Notes

- Backlinks must be earned—this file contains outreach templates and recommended targets. I cannot create external backlinks from this repo; you’ll need to publish content or ask site owners to link.
